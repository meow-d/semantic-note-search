# Semantic Note Search
### Unserious introduction
🚀 Meet Semantic Note Search ⚡ — where your ideas finally talk back.

We’re redefining note-taking for the AI era. This isn’t another productivity app — it’s your thinking partner, your memory amplifier, your second brain’s interface layer. Ask anything in plain language, and Semantic Note Search finds, connects, and contextualizes your notes like it already knew what you meant.

Forget the old days of keyword hunting and file spelunking — that’s peasant tech. We built Semantic Note Search to make your notes feel alive, to surface insights you didn’t even remember writing.

🧠 Backed by cutting-edge semantic models and obsessive design, this is note search that understands you.
Not just faster — smarter. Personal. Effortless.

Welcome to the future of knowledge flow.
Welcome to Semantic Note Search — your thoughts, instantly searchable. ✨

### Serious introduction
Semantic search TUI for markdown (and .txt) notes using Sentence Transformers. vibe coded, for personal use when i was bored this afternoon. unfortunately i don't actually have a use for it, because i link my notes properly i never had trouble finding notes in the first place.

## Usage
```bash
# install
git clone meow-d/semantic-note-search
cd semantic-note-search
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run
python main.py /path/to/your/notes
```

First run will take a while as it'll need to download the sentence transformer model and build a search index.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Textual
- Sentence Transformers
- PyTorch
- [textual[syntax]] (for markdown highlighting)

## License
MIT License - feel free to use, modify, and distribute.

## Todo
- [x] Fix loading screen display issues
- [x] Update test to match new changes
- [x] Remove all try:imports, and just import normally
- [x] Different modes should have different UIs, currently all panels are displayed all at once
- [x] remove all print() statements that can't be viewed anyways
- [x] remove unused code, see warnings
- [x] nicer loading screen
- [x] i don't see the scan confirmation ui in test mode (not sure if it's in normal mode either). is it there, or is it just not showing in test mode?
- [x] double check if the search still works, it doesn't seem to be working in test mode, or normal mode either
- [x] change terminology to "checking index cache" "indexing" rather than "building cache"
- [x] Fixed search functionality - typing in the text box now works for queries of length 1+, refactored unreliable model check to use self.test_mode, fixed test search to return results.
- [x] improve wikilink suggestion
  - [x] files cannot link to themselves
  - [x] wikilink preview should have the wikilink applied
  - [x] wikilink preview should have the wikilink highlighted with bg color, and scrolled into view (proper scrolling implemented with cursor positioning)
  - [x] double check if it ignores headings and yaml frontmatter and existing links

- [x] Click should select item
- [x] arrow keys scrolling should scroll the select item into view (need to refer to textual docs)
- [x] split code info files
- [x] different cache for different directories
- [x] the ui still gets stuck when indexing/building cache
- [x] investigate slow TUI startup

- [x] more minimal, borderless startup screen, centered app title, then current progress (for which stage), detailed progress (for which file it's indexing), and a progress bar (updated with detailed progress too)
- [ ] major bug: cache not saved when using custom notes dir, and using cuda.
- [ ] major bug: it also displays "notes not found"
- [ ] you STILL can't quit in the loading screen
- [-] better wikilink preview
  - [ ] on the left, the preview should be compact, in two lines. first line being: 0.740 test.md (machine learning). second line being   -> ml.md (note title that you get from the first h1)
  - [ ] on the right, remove duplicate wikilink suggestions info. the first and second note should just be displayed as is, in two different panes.
  - [x] the button to switch modes back should be at the top bar. and it doesn't work at all. ensure that switching back and forth will not cause the wikilink suggestion results to be lost so the user can switch without havingt to rescan
  - [ ] the swith mode button has zero height?

- [ ] confirmation screen is malformed, some text pushes the box
